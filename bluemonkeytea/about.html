		<h3>About Us</h3>
		<p>Opened in October 2002, Blue Monkey Tea is a specialty tea store located in Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our tea shop features over 400 varieties of teas, a vast assortment of teapots and tea gadgets, and international sweets. In addition, we offer tea classes and tea tastings every month. </p>

		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>The original store, Wicks & Beans, was established in May of 2002. We expanded our assortments and space, and changed the name of the store to Margaret's Fine Imports. On May 9th, 2017 we opened a store in Carnegie and changed both store names to Blue Monkey Tea. The Carnegie PA location moved to Pittsburgh in February of 2019.</p>

		<p>We've grown into a classic neighborhood Tea Specialty store that consistently offers excellent service to our beloved customers. We canâ€™t wait to serve you!</p>

		<h3>About the Owner</h3>
		<img src="images/owner.png" alt="Owner Photo"/>
		<p>Margaret Harris is the owner of Blue Monkey Tea and is one of Pittsburgh's primary tea experts. As a tea consultant, Margaret  regularly conducts classes and workshops on tea at a variety of venues, including colleges, clubs, associations, corporations, and at her store. A native of Poland, where tea is the primary household beverage, her lifelong experience with tea began quite early: she may have had her first "cup of tea" when she was only one day old!</p> 

		<p>Margaret is a graduate of the Warsaw Medical College, which has enabled her to incorporate her medical knowledge into her teachings on the health aspects of teas and tisanes. She is a founding member of the Western Pennsylvania Tea Business Association, as well as several other business and professional groups.</p>
